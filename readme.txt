System Design Challenge for Full Stack Engineering Role
Objective:
Design a simplified, scalable loan approval system that can evaluate loan applications, calculate the risk of lending, and approve or reject applications based on predefined criteria. The system should be able to handle a high volume of loan applications, be easily maintainable, and allow for the addition of new features.

Requirements:
Define a Loan Application class with attributes such as applicant's name, credit score, loan amount, loan purpose, income, employment status, and other relevant information.
Develop a Risk Assessment module to analyze loan applications based on factors like credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, loan amount, and purpose. Assign a risk score to each application.
Implement a Loan Approval module that uses the risk score and predefined lending criteria to approve or reject a loan application.
Design a RESTful API to expose the loan approval functionality, supporting operations like submitting a new loan application, retrieving the status of a submitted application, and optionally updating or deleting an existing application.
Add a scalable data storage solution for persisting loan applications and their statuses, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
Incorporate monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the performance and status of the system.
Write unit and integration tests to validate the functionality and performance of the system.
Provide clear documentation on the system design, architecture, and instructions on how to set up, run, and test the system.
Deliverables:
A Python project containing the Loan Application class, Risk Assessment module, Loan Approval module, RESTful API implementation, queue-based processing architecture, data storage solution, monitoring and logging mechanisms, and unit and integration tests.
A README file with instructions on how to set up, run, and test the system, along with documentation on the system design and architecture.
Time Commitment:
We expect that this challenge should take you between 8 and 12 hours to complete. We kindly ask you to submit your solution within 5 days of receiving this challenge.

Evaluation Criteria:
System design and architecture: Your ability to design and implement a scalable, maintainable, and modular system.
Code quality and organization: Well-structured, modular, and easy-to-understand code.
Functionality: The system's accuracy in assessing loan applications, approving or rejecting them based on predefined criteria, and handling a high volume of requests.
Test coverage: Unit and integration tests covering a reasonable range of test cases and edge cases.
Documentation: Clear instructions on how to set up, run, and test the system, as well as thorough documentation on the system design and architecture.
Submission
Please submit your completed project as a .zip file or provide a link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) containing your solution.
